DESCRIPTION:
------------
The default configuration works if you store you music as follow:
 - One folder per artist
 - One folder per album
    - In the artist folder
    - With an optional year starting the album folder name (with separator " - ")
 - Files in an album folder can be
    - An MP3 file (.mp3 case sensitive) with a 2 digits number starting the filename (with separator " - ")
	- A cover names cover.jpg or cover.png (case sensitive)
	- A playlist named playlist.m3u (case sensitive)

This is the default configuration and the default behaviour. No need to copy any configuration file.
