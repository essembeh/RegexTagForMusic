DESCRIPTION:
------------
This configuration works if you store you music as follow:
 - Like the "default" configuration but the album folder and the artist folder are the same one
    - Folder is named "Artist - Album"
	- With an optional year between the two fields "Artist - 1997 - Album"
	- The separator is " - "

Note: This folder structure does not prevent multi entries per Artist because the Artist name is not unique.
      You can have "Bob - Album One" and "BOB - Album two" and you will have two Artists in your mp3 player (mostly are case sensitive).
