The folders contains configuration files to allow RegexTagForMusic manage different ways to manage Music.
In each folder, a README describes the specificities and an example tree.

If a configuration match the way you manage music
 - Copy the XML files to the "config/" folder of RegexTagForMusic and overwrite the default files
 - Or copy them into a folder named "$HOME/.rtfm"
   Files in this personal folder will "override" files in the application configuration folder.


If your folder structure does not match any of the example configuration, contact me contact me (by mail or open 
a ticket) with your folder tree and I will try to help you.
