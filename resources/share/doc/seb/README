DESCRIPTION:
------------
The default configuration works if you store you music as follow:
 - Three main folders
    - Albums to store albums
    - Singles to store single
    - Saga to store mp3 sagas
 - In Albums folder
    - One folder per artist
    - One folder per album
       - In the artist folder
       - With an optional year starting the album folder name (with separator " - ")
         Note: If the year is present the mp3 tag album will also contain the year so that they are sorted on mp3 players
    - Files in an album folder can be
       - An MP3 file (.mp3 case sensitive) with a 2 digits number starting the filename (with separator " - ")
       - A cover names cover.jpg or cover.png (case sensitive)
 - In Singles folder
    - Single mp3 files names "Artist - Song Title.mp3"
      Note: The artist will be set as album in mp3 tag and a fixed artist in mp3 tag (I personnaly find this very usefull)
 - In Saga folder
    - On folder per saga
    - All episodes named "Episode xx.mp3" will have xx as track number
      Note: The name of the saga will be set as album in mp3 tag and a fixed artist in mp3 tag (I personnaly find this very usefull)

Note: This is my configuration, it has strange behaviour, use with caution ;)
